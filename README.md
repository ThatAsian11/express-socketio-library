# Library 2.0

Remade my [express-library](https://github.com/ThatAsian11/express-library) project using SocketIO and Express

This one looks and behaves almost exactly like Library 1.0 except that the page never reloads and some other refinements (animations, loading gif, etc.)

I also didn't use a templating engine for this one (Unlike the previous iteration which uses Pug/Jade)
Everything is rendered using pure Javascript

Use `npm start` or `nodemon start` to start server
